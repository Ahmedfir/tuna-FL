# The tokenizer package

The tokenizer package allows to tokenize java and C/C++ source code either at the line level or at the file level.

## What are the different tokenizers provided?

### Generic

* UTFTokenizer based on the one created for Terrier, see: [UTF Tokeniser](https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-core/blob/93db6e25c11e2e1f77d64ab442c2758265035feb/src/core/org/terrier/indexing/tokenisation/UTFTokeniser.java)

Tokenizer that use everything non alphanumerical as a delimiter, delimiter in a row are kept together, while only space delimiter are removed.

Available at line and file level.


### Java

#### Code Based

* UTFWocTokenizer: same tokenizer as UTF except that comments are removed (available only at file level)
* JavaLemmeTokenizer: Tokenizer based on the lemmatization of java code performed by [Java Parser](http://javaparser.org), available for file level as well as line level
* JavaLemmeWocTokenizer: Same as JavaLemmeTokenizer, except that comments are removed, available only at the file level

#### AST Based (only available at the file Level)
* DepthFirst: Tokenize according to the AST generated by JavaParser and go through the tree depth first, each token correspond to the text serialization of a node
* BreadthFirst: Tokenize according to the AST generated by JavaParser and go through the tree breadth first, each token correspond to the text serialization of a node
* DepthFirstPruned: same than DepthFirst except that intermediate node of the tree are removed
* BreadthFirstPruned: same than BreadthFirst except that intermediate node of the tree are removed

### C/C++

#### Code Based

* CPPLemmeTokenizer:Tokenizer based on the lemmatization of cpp code performed by [ANTLR CPP14 parser](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/cpp/CPP14.g4), available for file level as well as line level

#### AST Based (only available at the file Level)

* CPPASTTokenizer: Tokenize according to the AST generated by [Joern](https://github.com/octopus-platform/joern) and go through the tree depth first, each token correspond to the text serialization of a node


## Requirements
Dependencies are handled through maven, all of them will be downloaded except for joern-antlr that need to be installed first and that can be found at [this link](https://github.com/electricalwind/joernANTLR)
